<h1>SuperBlink RISC-V Assembly Language Project</h1>

<p> This project was based on the <a src="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6noQ0vZDAdh_aGvqKvxd0brXImHXMuLY">RISC-V ASM Tutorial</a> made available by Western Digital Corporation on Youtube.
It is an introduction to RISC-V using VSCode with the PlatformIO extension, and on the SiFive HiFive1. The project was done with C code and assembly.
</p>

<ul>The project goals:
<li>Access the various GPIO pins on the HiFive1;</li>
<li>Identify and manage the address location of the LEDs;</li>
<li>Write the assembly language for HiFive1 LEDs;</li>
<li>To set up and write the assembly code with include files and target the LEDs;</li>
<li>Set the LED values in assembly;</li>
<li>Set the delay loop and timer to control the LED blink rate on the HiFive1 board.</li>
</ul>
